# Introduction

Welcome to the **EpigeneticAgePipeline** package, an R toolkit designed
for the comprehensive processing and analysis of DNA methylation data.
Our package aims to provide an efficient and integrated solution for
several key functionalities: The purpose of this vigentte is to show
usage of the **main()** function.

## Key Features

### Epigenetic Age Measures

-   **Generate diverse epigenetic age measures** directly from beta
    values or IDAT files.
-   Includes renowned measures such as the **Horvath Clock**, **Hannum
    Clock**, **Levine/PhenoAge Clock**, among others.
-   Each clock offers unique sets of CpG sites, array types, and cell
    type specificities for different tissue types.

### Visualization and Quantitative Analysis

-   Presents visual and quantitative mediums to **explore and analyze
    various epigenetic age measures**.
-   Offers matrix plots, line plots, and grouped bar charts for **easy
    interpretation and comparison** of age estimates against
    chronological age and covariates.

### Cell Count Estimation

-   Utilizes methylation data from provided IDAT files to **estimate
    cell counts** for specific cell types including B Cells, CD4T Cells,
    CD8T Cells, Granulocytes, Monocytes, and Nucleated Red Blood cells.

# Installation

To install the EpigeneticAgePipeline, which will include the data used
in the upcoming example:

``` r

if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install()

packages_to_install <- c(
    "minfi",
    "IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICanno.ilm10b4.hg19",
    "IlluminaHumanMethylationEPICmanifest",
    "methylclock",
    "methylclockData",
    "FlowSorted.CordBlood.450k",
    "IlluminaHumanMethylation450kmanifest",
    "IlluminaHumanMethylation450kanno.ilmn12.hg19",
    "IlluminaHumanMethylation27kmanifest",
    "IlluminaHumanMethylation27kanno.ilmn12.hg19"
)

for (package in packages_to_install) {
    if (!requireNamespace(package, quietly = TRUE)) {
        BiocManager::install(package)
    }
}

#BiocManager::install("EpigeneticAgePipeline")
remotes::install_github('CastellaniLab/EpigeneticAgePipeline')
library(EpigeneticAgePipeline)
```

Then run the following code:

``` r
options(timeout = 120)
downloadDirectory <- "EpigeneticAgePipelineDataset-main"
downloadURL <- paste0("https://github.com/StanRaye/",
                        "EpigeneticAgePipelineDataset",
                        "/archive/refs/heads/main.zip")
installDirectory <- paste0(path.package("EpigeneticAgePipeline"),"/extdata/")
setwd(installDirectory)
utils::download.file(url = downloadURL, destfile = "asdf.zip")
utils::unzip("asdf.zip", exdir = installDirectory)
extractedFiles <- list.files(paste0(installDirectory, downloadDirectory),
                            full.names = TRUE)
file.copy(from = extractedFiles, to = installDirectory, overwrite = TRUE,
                            recursive = TRUE)
```

# Example

The following code will analyze a set of beta values with 3 samples, and
will output the measures of epigenetic age.

```{R}
library("EpigeneticAgePipeline")
```

```{R}
myDirectory <- paste0(path.package("EpigeneticAgePipeline"),"/extdata/")
```

```{R}
message("The `betaValues.csv` file used in this example was obtained from:\n")
message("https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi\n\n")
if (file.exists(paste0(myDirectory, "betaValues.csv")))
{
    EpigeneticAgePipeline::main( 
    directory = myDirectory, #in normal cases, this will be  the directory of 
                        #where
                        #you will keep all the input files
    useBeta = TRUE, #this is true since we are providing a data frame containing
                        #beta values 
    arrayType = "450K", #in this case we know that the beta values that we are
                        #being provided
    useSampleSheet = FALSE #since we are not using a sample sheet
)  
    knitr::kable(exportDf) #printing out generated epigenetic age estimates
}

```

```{R echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
